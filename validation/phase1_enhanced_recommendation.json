Keep HR strictly below 136 bpm for entire duration. If HR drifts above 136, walk until it drops back down. Focus on easy conversational pace - you should be able to speak in full sentences. This is active recovery to promote blood flow without adding training stress.","target_duration_minutes":30,"intensity":3,"rationale":"With Training Readiness at 30/100 and a quality workout just completed today, the body needs active recovery rather than rest or additional training stress. A short Zone 1 run promotes circulation and recovery while respecting the low readiness state. The PEAKING status means maintaining form without digging into recovery reserves is the priority."},"recovery_tips":["Prioritize hydration - you're at 0.0L of 3.6L goal with 0.8L sweat loss from today's workout. Drink 1-2L of water with electrolytes this evening","Aim for 8+ hours of sleep tonight to match your excellent 8.2 hours last night - sleep is your strongest recovery metric right now","Consider light stretching or foam rolling this evening to aid muscle recovery from today's 50-minute run at tempo effort"],"ai_reasoning":"The Training Readiness Score of 30/100 is the dominant signal here - Garmin's AI has assessed multiple physiological markers and determined readiness is POOR. While individual metrics like sleep (8.2hrs, quality 80) and resting HR (41 bpm, slightly below baseline) look acceptable, the HRV is 7.8% below personal baseline and trending downward, indicating accumulated fatigue. Most critically, the athlete completed a quality running workout TODAY (0 hours ago) with strong aerobic effect (4.0), meaning muscles are actively recovering right now. The PEAKING_2 training status confirms this is a maintenance phase where preserving fitness without overreaching is paramount. The low ACWR (0.66) might suggest room for more volume, but combined with poor readiness, it indicates recent training has been effective but fatiguing. Recommendation: easy 30-minute Zone 1 recovery run to promote active recovery while respecting the body's clear signals that it needs lighter stress today.","language":"en","enhanced_metrics":{"training_readiness_score":30,"vo2_max":55.0,"training_status":"PEAKING_2","spo2_avg":99.0,"spo2_min":94,"respiration_avg":11.0},"extended_signals":{"hydration":{"intake_ml":0.0,"goal_ml":3634.0,"sweat_loss_ml":834.0}},"recent_training_load":{"avg_training_load":20.800000190734863,"activity_count":5,"total_distance_km":26.0,"total_duration_min":222.0,"activity_breakdown":{"running":{"count":2,"total_duration_min":101.79809977213542,"total_distance_km":18.25196044921875,"impact_level":"high","avg_hr":131.0,"total_training_effect":7.0},"yoga":{"count":2,"total_duration_min":80.82771809895834,"total_distance_km":0.0,"impact_level":"moderate","avg_hr":63.5,"total_training_effect":0.0},"trail_running":{"count":1,"total_duration_min":39.051350911458336,"total_distance_km":7.75702001953125,"impact_level":"high","avg_hr":138.0,"total_training_effect":3.4000000953674316}}},"historical_baselines":{"hrv":{"baseline_hrv":49.9,"current_hrv":46,"7_day_avg":43.6,"deviation_pct":-7.8,"is_concerning":false,"trend":"decreasing","data_points":31},"resting_hr":{"baseline_rhr":42.5,"current_rhr":41,"deviation_bpm":-1.5,"is_elevated":false,"data_points":31},"sleep":{"baseline_hours":6.8,"current_hours":8.2,"7_day_avg":6.8,"sleep_debt_hours":0.3,"is_sleep_deprived":false,"data_points":31},"acwr":{"acute_load":104.0,"chronic_load":156.5,"acwr":0.66,"status":"undertraining","injury_risk":"low","acute_activity_count":4,"chronic_activity_count":30},"training_trends":{"total_activities":34,"total_distance_km":243.9,"total_duration_hours":30.7,"avg_weekly_distance":56.9,"consecutive_training_days":1}},"readiness_history":[{"date":"2025-10-15","score":15},{"date":"2025-10-16","score":31},{"date":"2025-10-17","score":1},{"date":"2025-10-18","score":1},{"date":"2025-10-19","score":27},{"date":"2025-10-20","score":36},{"date":"2025-10-21","score":30}],"latest_data_sync":"2025-10-21T10:38:42Z","generated_at":"2025-10-21T11:27:30.728619Z"}
