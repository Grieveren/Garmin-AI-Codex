# Architecture Backlog

_Last updated: 2025-10-20_

This living document captures post-MVP architecture and reliability work. Use it to create focused branches/issues and to track progress as items move from planning to done.

## Phase 2 Completed Features (2025-10-19 to 2025-10-20)

Following Phase 1.5 infrastructure work, several Phase 2 AI intelligence features have been implemented and shipped to production:

1. **Activity Type Differentiation** _(‚úÖ completed 2025-10-19)_ ‚Äî AI now distinguishes between high/moderate/low impact activities.
   - Classifies workouts by training effect, HR zones, and duration (see `app/services/ai_analyzer.py`).
   - Provides nuanced recovery recommendations (e.g., yoga after hard run vs. run after run).
   - 17 comprehensive tests added to validate classification logic.

2. **Multi-language Support** _(‚úÖ completed 2025-10-19)_ ‚Äî AI recommendations now available in English and German.
   - Configured via `app/config/prompts.yaml` with `default_language` setting.
   - Full localization of explanations, tips, and workout guidance.
   - Extensible to additional languages via YAML translation blocks.

3. **Dashboard Reorganization** _(‚úÖ completed 2025-10-20)_ ‚Äî Recommendation-first layout with enhanced UX.
   - Redesigned to prioritize daily AI guidance (user-focused flow).
   - Custom CSS/JS in `app/static/` for responsive design.
   - Activity breakdown by impact level with visual indicators.
   - Graceful degradation for missing metrics.

## Phase 1.5 Priorities

Each item is scoped to be tackled in its own branch/PR for ease of review.

1. **Scheduler Integration** _(‚úÖ completed)_ ‚Äî wire `scripts/run_scheduler.py` to execute the Garmin sync + AI readiness analysis outside the web process.
   - Replace the placeholder job with calls into the existing sync/analysis services.
   - Ensure the locking strategy prevents concurrent runs across environments.
   - Add logging around job start/end and failure scenarios.

2. **Configuration & Secrets Hardening** _(‚úÖ completed)_ ‚Äî enforce environment-based settings across the stack.
   - Require critical keys (Garmin, Anthropic, secret key) at startup via Pydantic validation.
   - Document environment overrides and default ports/hosts.
   - Remove hard-coded fallbacks that mask missing configuration.

3. **Logging & Observability** _(‚úÖ completed)_ ‚Äî centralize structured logs for Garmin and AI calls.
   - Introduce a shared logger (JSON-friendly) and consistent log levels.
   - Capture request/response summaries (without secrets) for sync jobs and API calls.
   - Define an error-handling pattern so failures surface in one place.

4. **Testing Expansion** _(‚úÖ completed)_ ‚Äî improve automated coverage beyond unit tests.
   - Add end-to-end tests that stub Garmin responses and assert the readiness JSON payload.
   - Provide fixtures for scheduler jobs so they can be invoked inside pytest.
   - Guard against regressions when AI prompt/config changes.

5. **AI Prompt & Config Refactor** _(‚úÖ completed)_ ‚Äî externalize prompt templates and thresholds.
   - Store Claude prompts and recommendation thresholds as versioned files/config entries.
   - Load them through a dedicated settings object for easier experimentation.
   - Document the process for updating prompts/models safely.

6. **Persistence & Frontend Follow-up** _(‚úÖ completed)_ ‚Äî foundation for persistence + UI iteration.
   - Established Alembic migrations and helper utilities so PostgreSQL deployments stay in sync.
   - Hardened database session handling to ensure commits/rollbacks are scoped per request/job.
   - Extracted dashboard CSS/JS into the `app/static` bundle to unblock richer visualization work.

## How to Use This Backlog

- Create a branch per bullet (e.g., `architecture/scheduler-integration`) and reference this doc in the PR description.
- Update the relevant bullet with status notes (`‚úÖ`, `üõ†Ô∏è in progress`, or links to tickets) as work lands.
- Feel free to append new architecture items here rather than burying them in the specification.
