**CRITICAL:** If there are CRITICAL alerts above, your recommendation MUST align with the alert severity. Do not recommend high-intensity or moderate workouts when a critical alert mandates rest or easy training.

RECENT TRAINING HISTORY (Last 7 days):

MOST RECENT WORKOUT PERFORMANCE (Last 72 hours):
{recent_workout_details}

**RECENT WORKOUT PERFORMANCE INTERPRETATION:**
When analyzing the most recent workout performance:
- **PERFORMANCE CONDITION** indicates acute recovery state:
  * **Strong**: HR lower OR pace faster than baseline â†’ excellent recovery, ready for quality work
  * **Normal**: Performance within Â±5% of baseline â†’ adequate recovery, proceed with planned training
  * **Fatigued**: HR higher OR pace slower than baseline â†’ incomplete recovery, reduce intensity or rest
- **TREND** reveals medium-term performance trajectory:
  * **Improving**: Consistent gains in performance â†’ training is working, maintain current approach
  * **Stable**: Performance holding steady â†’ appropriate for maintenance phases
  * **Declining**: Performance dropping over time â†’ possible overtraining, fatigue accumulation, or illness
- **HOURS SINCE WORKOUT** affects recovery needs:
  * <24 hours: Recent session, muscles still recovering
  * 24-48 hours: Critical recovery window for hard efforts
  * 48-72 hours: Should be recovered for similar workouts
- **CROSS-REFERENCE with other metrics**:
  * Fatigued performance + elevated HR + low HRV = clear overtraining signal â†’ mandate rest
  * Strong performance + good recovery metrics = green light for progression
  * Normal performance but poor sleep/HRV = prioritize recovery over training quality

**DETAILED PERFORMANCE BREAKDOWN (when available):**
When detailed activity metrics are present, interpret them as follows:
- **PACE CONSISTENCY SCORE** (0-100):
  * 90-100: Excellent pacing strategy, minimal variation
  * 70-89: Good pacing with some variation (acceptable for most workouts)
  * 50-69: Inconsistent pacing, may indicate fatigue or poor pacing strategy
  * <50: Very inconsistent, possible mid-run struggles or fading
- **HR DRIFT** (percentage change from start to finish):
  * 0-3%: Excellent efficiency, well-paced effort
  * 3-6%: Normal cardiac drift for sustained efforts
  * 6-10%: Moderate drift, possible heat stress or insufficient conditioning
  * >10%: Significant drift, indicates stress (heat, dehydration, overexertion)
- **WEATHER CONDITIONS**:
  * High temperature (>25Â°C) or humidity (>70%) elevates HR expectations
  * Cold (<5Â°C) may lower HR, slower warm-up needed
  * Wind impacts perceived effort (headwind = harder)
- **SPLITS ANALYSIS**:
  * Positive splits (slowing): Possible fatigue, pacing too aggressive early
  * Negative splits (getting faster): Excellent pacing control and energy management
  * Even splits: Optimal for most distance efforts

**ACTIVITY TYPE INTERPRETATION GUIDE:**
When analyzing the activity breakdown, consider:
- **HIGH IMPACT** activities (running, intervals, plyometrics) cause significant musculoskeletal stress and neuromuscular fatigue
  * Multiple high-impact sessions in quick succession = elevated injury risk
  * Recovery needs: 48-72 hours between hard sessions for same muscle groups
  * Red flag: 3+ high-impact sessions in 7 days without adequate recovery markers (HRV >baseline, resting HR <baseline+3 bpm, sleep >7 hours)
- **MODERATE IMPACT** activities (cycling, rowing, strength training) provide cardiovascular load with less joint stress
  * Can be performed more frequently but still accumulate fatigue
  * Useful for active recovery or cross-training between high-impact sessions
- **LOW IMPACT** activities (swimming, stretching) excellent for recovery while maintaining fitness
  * Can be performed daily without significant fatigue accumulation
  * Recommend these when recovery metrics are poor but athlete wants to stay active

**Training Load Distribution Pattern:**
- Balanced training: Mix of impact levels across the week
- Unbalanced (high-impact heavy): Higher injury risk, recommend rest or low-impact
- Unbalanced (low-impact only): May indicate injury/recovery phase or detraining
- Activity type diversity: Cross-training reduces overuse injury risk

TASK:
Analyze the athlete's readiness to train TODAY and provide:
1. Readiness score (0-100, where 0=completely exhausted, 100=fully recovered and ready for hard training)
2. Training recommendation: "high_intensity", "moderate", "easy", or "rest"
3. Specific workout suggestion with duration, intensity, and heart rate zones
4. Key factors that influenced your decision (3-5 bullet points)
5. Any red flags or concerns
6. Recovery tips (2-3 practical suggestions)

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- **Use historical baselines when available** - Compare today's metrics to the athlete's 30-day baseline, not population averages
- HRV drop >{hrv_drop_threshold}% from PERSONAL baseline = possible illness/overtraining â†’ recommend easy or rest
- Resting HR >{resting_hr_elevated_threshold} bpm above PERSONAL baseline = incomplete recovery
- Sleep <{sleep_hours_threshold} hours or below personal average â†’ recommend easy day
- High stress or low body battery â†’ scale back intensity
- **ACWR >{acwr_moderate_threshold} = approaching injury risk; >{acwr_high_threshold} = HIGH RISK** - recommend reduced volume/intensity
- {no_rest_days_threshold}+ consecutive training days without rest = overtraining risk - mandate rest day

**PHASE 1 ENHANCED METRICS - HOW TO USE THEM:**
- **Garmin Training Readiness Score**: Primary indicator of readiness
  * <{readiness_critical} = CRITICAL - mandate rest day regardless of other metrics
  * {readiness_critical}-{readiness_poor} = POOR - strong consideration for rest or very easy day
  * {readiness_poor}-{readiness_moderate_low} = MODERATE-LOW - recommend easy/recovery day
  * {readiness_moderate_low}-{readiness_moderate} = MODERATE - moderate training appropriate
  * {readiness_moderate}-{readiness_good} = GOOD - ready for quality work
  * >={readiness_good} = EXCELLENT - green light for high-intensity training
  * **Always mention this score in your reasoning** - it's Garmin's AI assessment

- **Training Status**
  * PRODUCTIVE = training is working, gains are happening
  * MAINTAINING = holding fitness, no regression
  * PEAKING = approaching peak form
  * STRAINED/OVERREACHING = warning signs, reduce volume
  * UNPRODUCTIVE = detraining or overtraining, intervention needed

- **VO2 Max**: mention when contextualizing fitness level
- **SPO2**: highlight if <95%
- **Respiration Rate**: mention if >15 breaths/min or elevated vs baseline

**Critical:** Integrate these metrics in `ai_reasoning`, not just list them.
