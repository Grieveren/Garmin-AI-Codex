HISTORICAL BASELINES (30-day analysis):
- HRV Analysis:
  * Current: {hrv_current}ms
  * 30-day baseline: {hrv_baseline}ms
  * 7-day average: {hrv_avg_7}ms
  * Deviation: {hrv_deviation}%
  * Trend: {hrv_trend}
  * ⚠️ Concerning: {hrv_flag}

- Resting Heart Rate:
  * Current: {rhr_current} bpm
  * Baseline: {rhr_baseline} bpm
  * Deviation: {rhr_deviation} bpm
  * ⚠️ Elevated: {rhr_flag}

- Sleep Pattern:
  * Current: {sleep_current} hours
  * Baseline: {sleep_baseline} hours
  * 7-day average: {sleep_avg_7} hours
  * Weekly sleep debt: {sleep_debt} hours
  * ⚠️ Sleep deprived: {sleep_flag}

- Training Load (ACWR - Injury Prevention):
  * Acute load (7 days): {acwr_acute}
  * Chronic load (28 days): {acwr_chronic}
  * ACWR Ratio: {acwr_ratio}
  * Status: {acwr_status}
  * Injury risk: {acwr_risk}
  * ⚠️ WARNING: {acwr_warning}

- Training Trends (30 days):
  * Total activities: {trends_total}
  * Total distance: {trends_distance}km
  * Average weekly distance: {trends_weekly_distance}km/week
  * Consecutive training days: {trends_consecutive} days
  * ⚠️ No rest days: {trends_rest_flag}

IMPORTANT CONTEXT FROM HISTORICAL DATA:
* You now have 30 days of baseline data to compare against
* This allows you to detect deviations from the athlete's NORMAL ranges
* HRV drop >{hrv_drop_threshold}% from baseline is a major red flag for overtraining/illness
* Resting HR elevation >{resting_hr_elevated_threshold}bpm suggests incomplete recovery
* ACWR >{acwr_moderate_threshold} indicates increasing injury risk; >{acwr_high_threshold} is dangerous
* {no_rest_days_threshold}+ consecutive training days without rest increases overtraining risk
