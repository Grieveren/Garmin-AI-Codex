# AI-Powered Training Optimization System
## Project Specification

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

Build an intelligent fitness training optimization system that:
- **Automatically fetches** Garmin health and training data
- **Analyzes patterns** using Claude AI to understand your body's signals
- **Generates daily workout recommendations** based on recovery status
- **Creates adaptive training plans** aligned with your goals
- **Prevents overtraining and injury** through smart load management
- **Provides actionable insights** through AI-powered analysis

### 🔍 MVP Scope vs. Advanced Enhancements

To keep the build focused while still pointing to future capabilities, treat the project as two concentric scopes:

- **MVP (deliver now):**
  - Automated Garmin data ingestion, storage, and FastAPI access
  - Daily readiness analysis with Claude, adaptive training plan updates, and notification delivery
  - Web dashboard with today’s recommendation, weekly plan, key metrics, and AI chat
  - Supporting scripts for setup, manual sync, and backfill, plus core tests and documentation
- **Advanced Backlog (later):**
  - Deep analytics (race predictions, sleep-performance correlations, efficiency trends)
  - Third-party integrations (Strava, TrainingPeaks), mobile/IoT extensions, and social features
  - Expanded data exports, PDF reporting, and other “nice to have” endpoints

Everything else in this spec is organized to make the MVP attainable first, with advanced ideas called out explicitly as optional follow-on work.

### ⚠️ Critical Considerations Before Starting

**1. Unofficial Garmin Integration**
This system uses the `garminconnect` Python library, which is unofficial and reverse-engineers Garmin's web API. This means:
- ❌ Not endorsed by Garmin
- ❌ May violate Garmin's Terms of Service
- ⚠️ Could break if Garmin updates their system
- ✅ Works reliably for personal use (as of Oct 2025)
- ✅ Actively maintained by community

**VERIFIED STATUS (October 18, 2025):**
- ✅ garminconnect==0.2.30 confirmed working with Python 3.14 (compatibility patch applied via `app/compat/pydantic_eval_patch.py`)
- ✅ MFA authentication flow implemented and tested
- ✅ Token caching in `.garmin_tokens/` directory working reliably
- ✅ ALL 72 GET methods tested and documented (see GARMIN_API_DATA_AVAILABLE.md)
- ⚠️ get_user_summary() method has known bugs - use fallback to get_stats()

**MFA Authentication:**
- First-time login requires 6-digit verification code from Garmin
- Web UI at `/manual/mfa` provides user-friendly code entry
- Tokens cached for subsequent logins without re-authentication
- Rate limiting: Wait 20-30 minutes between failed attempts

**Alternative**: Use Apple HealthKit if you're willing to build iOS-only.

**2. Claude API Costs**
Estimated monthly costs for AI analysis:
- Daily readiness analysis: ~$0.10-0.20/day
- Weekly insights: ~$0.50/week
- Training plan generation: ~$1-2/plan
- Chat queries: ~$0.05-0.15/query
- **Total estimate: $5-15/month** for regular use

Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 (most intelligent model). Can reduce costs by:
- Using prompt caching (automatically enabled)
- Reducing analysis frequency
- Limiting data context window

**3. Time Commitment**
- Initial setup: 4-8 hours
- Full implementation: 20-40 hours over 5 weeks
- Daily usage: 5 minutes (automated after setup)

**4. Technical Prerequisites**
- Python programming knowledge (intermediate level)
- Basic understanding of APIs and databases
- Familiarity with FastAPI or Flask
- Understanding of heart rate training zones and HRV
- Comfortable with command line

## 🤖 AI Analysis Engine - CORE FEATURE

### AIAnalyzer Class (`services/ai_analyzer.py`)

This is the intelligence center of the system. It uses Claude AI to analyze your data and provide recommendations.

#### Key Methods:

#### 1. **Daily Readiness Analysis** (MOST IMPORTANT)

```python
async def analyze_daily_readiness(self, date: str) -> DailyReadinessResponse:
    """
    Analyzes whether you should train hard, easy, or rest today.
    
    This runs every morning automatically and is the core feature.
    
    Inputs analyzed:
    - Last night's sleep (duration, quality, sleep stages)
    - This morning's HRV (compared to 7-day and 30-day baseline)
    - Resting heart rate (compared to baseline)
    - Yesterday's training load
    - Last 7 days cumulative training stress
    - Current acute:chronic workload ratio
    - Previous day's recovery status

    Minimum viable data set:
    - Sleep summary, resting HR, HRV, recent activities/training load

    Optional enrichments (use when Garmin provides them, fall back gracefully otherwise):
    - Body battery, stress score, detailed sleep stages, recovery time hints
    
    Output:
    {
        "date": "2025-10-16",
        "readiness_score": 82,  # 0-100
        "recommendation": "moderate",  # high_intensity | moderate | easy | rest
        "confidence": "high",  # high | medium | low
        "key_factors": [
            "Sleep quality excellent (8.2 hours, 85% score)",
            "HRV normal at 62ms (your 7-day avg: 58ms)",
            "Resting HR at baseline: 48 bpm",
            "Training load stable, no spikes"
        ],
        "red_flags": [
            "Slight elevation in morning HR (+3 bpm from baseline)",
            "Only 2 hours deep sleep vs your usual 2.5 hours"
        ],
        "suggested_workout": {
            "type": "tempo_run",
            "description": "45-minute tempo run with 10min warm-up, 25min at threshold pace (zone 4), 10min cool-down",

            "intensity": 7,
            "rationale": "Your recovery metrics are good. Body is ready for moderate-high intensity. Threshold work will improve lactate clearance without excessive stress."
        },
        "alternative_workouts": [
            {
                "type": "easy_run",

                "target_hr_zone": "2"
            }
        ],
        "recovery_tips": [
            "Focus on hydration today - you tend to perform better when well-hydrated",
            "Consider foam rolling before workout - helps with your typical calf tightness",
            "Protein within 30min post-workout for optimal recovery"
        ],
        "warnings": [],

    }
    ```

**AI Prompt Structure:**
```python
prompt = f"""
You are an expert running coach and sports scientist analyzing an athlete's readiness to train.

ATHLETE PROFILE:
{user_profile}

TODAY'S PHYSIOLOGICAL DATA:
- Date: {date}
- Sleep last night: {sleep_data}
- HRV this morning: {hrv_data} (7-day baseline: {hrv_baseline}, 30-day: {hrv_30day})
- Resting HR: {rhr_data} (baseline: {rhr_baseline})
- Body Battery (if available): {body_battery}
- Stress level (if available): {stress_level}

RECENT TRAINING HISTORY (Last 7 days):
{recent_activities}

TRAINING LOAD METRICS:
- Acute training load (7-day): {acute_load}
- Chronic training load (28-day): {chronic_load}
- Acute:Chronic Ratio: {acwr} (optimal: 0.8-1.3, injury risk if >1.5)
- Current fitness: {fitness}
- Current fatigue: {fatigue}
- Form (fitness - fatigue): {form}

TRAINING GOAL:
{training_goal}

NEXT KEY WORKOUT IN PLAN:
{next_planned_workout}

TASK:
Analyze the athlete's readiness to train TODAY and provide:
1. Readiness score (0-100)
2. Training recommendation (high_intensity, moderate, easy, or rest)
3. Specific workout suggestion aligned with their goal
4. Key factors influencing the decision
5. Any red flags or concerns
6. Recovery optimization tips

Return response in this EXACT JSON format:
{json_schema}

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:
- HRV drop >10% from baseline = possible illness/overtraining, recommend easy or rest
- Resting HR elevated >5 bpm = stress/fatigue, scale back intensity
- Sleep <6 hours or sleep score <60 = inadequate recovery
- ACWR >1.5 = injury risk, recommend easy week
- Back-to-back high intensity days = risky, alternate with easy days
- After long runs (>90 min), need 24-48 hours easy
- Trust the data but also acknowledge subjective feel matters

Be specific with workout details (pace, HR zones, duration, structure).
"""
```

**Implementation note - VERIFIED:** All critical endpoints confirmed working (tested October 17, 2025):
- ✅ `get_sleep_data()` - Sleep duration, stages (deep/light/REM), quality score
- ✅ `get_hrv_data()` - HRV summary with baseline values, individual readings
- ✅ `get_heart_rates()` - Resting HR (42 bpm confirmed), max HR, all-day readings
- ✅ `get_stats()` - Steps, distance, calories, active minutes
- ✅ `get_stress_data()` - All-day stress monitoring, average/max stress
- ✅ `get_body_battery()` - Charged/drained amounts, current level
- ✅ `get_training_readiness()` - Daily readiness assessment
- ✅ `get_activities()` - Complete activity history with HR zones, splits, weather

See GARMIN_API_DATA_AVAILABLE.md for complete list of all 72 tested methods.

**Known Issues:**
- `get_user_summary()` may return list instead of dict - use fallback to `get_stats()`
- Rate limiting after ~5 failed MFA attempts - wait 20-30 minutes

#### 2. **Weekly Training Pattern Analysis**

```python
async def analyze_weekly_patterns(self, start_date: str, end_date: str) -> WeeklyInsights:
    """
    Analyzes a week (or multiple weeks) of training for patterns and balance.
    
    Identifies:
    - Training load distribution (are you doing too much intensity?)
    - Recovery adequacy (are rest days actually restful?)
    - Workout variety (too much running? need cross-training?)
    - Sleep and HRV trends
    - Overtraining risk
    
    Output includes:
    - Training load score
    - Intensity distribution (easy/moderate/hard ratio)
    - Overtraining risk score
    - Recommendations for next week
    - Specific adjustments needed
    """
```

#### 3. **Performance Trend Analysis**

```python
async def analyze_performance_trends(self, metric: str, period_days: int = 90) -> TrendAnalysis:
    """
    Analyzes long-term trends in key performance indicators.
    
    Metrics analyzed:
    - VO2 Max progression
    - Running pace at same HR (efficiency)
    - HR at same pace (fitness indicator)
    - HRV baseline trend
    - Resting HR trend
    - Body composition changes
    
    Identifies:
    - Improvements or plateaus
    - Potential causes
    - Breakthrough moments
    - Recommendations to break through plateaus
    """
```

#### 4. **Training Plan Generation** (NEW FEATURE)

```python
async def generate_training_plan(
    self, 
    goal: str,
    target_date: str,
    current_fitness_level: dict,
    constraints: dict
) -> TrainingPlan:
    """
    Generates a complete periodized training plan to achieve a goal.
    
    Example goals:
    - "Run a sub-3:30 marathon on December 1, 2025"
    - "Improve 5K time from 22:00 to 20:30"
    - "Build base fitness for 6 months"
    - "Recover from injury and return to running"
    
    Inputs:

AI selects from this library and customizes based on your fitness level and goals.

#### 6. **Activity Type Classification** (NEW - 2025-10-19)

```python
def _classify_activity_impact(self, activity: dict) -> str:
    """
    Classifies activities by impact level for nuanced recovery recommendations.

    Impact Levels:
    - HIGH: Running, plyometrics, training effect ≥3.0, HR zones 4-5 >70%, duration >90min
    - MODERATE: Cycling, rowing, strength training (training effect 2.5-3.0)
    - LOW: Swimming, yoga, stretching, recovery activities (training effect <2.5)

    Classification Rules:
    1. Check activity type (running/cycling/swimming/yoga/etc.)
    2. Calculate total training effect (aerobic + anaerobic)
    3. Analyze heart rate zones and duration
    4. Return impact level: "high" | "moderate" | "low"

    Why This Matters:
    - Yoga after hard run = good recovery strategy
    - Run after run without rest = injury risk
    - Cycling can bridge hard run sessions
    - Swimming provides cardiovascular work without joint stress

    Example Output (activity breakdown):
    {
        "high": {"count": 3, "total_distance_km": 30.5, "avg_duration_min": 45},
        "moderate": {"count": 2, "total_distance_km": 80.2, "avg_duration_min": 105},
        "low": {"count": 1, "total_distance_km": 0, "avg_duration_min": 30}
    }

    This data enriches AI analysis to recommend:
    - "You've done 3 high-impact runs this week. Consider low-impact today."
    - "Yesterday's yoga was good recovery. Ready for quality work today."
    - "Two hard runs in 48 hours without rest. Recommend easy or rest."
    """
```

**Classification Thresholds (configurable in `app/config/prompts.yaml`):**
```yaml
activity_classification:
  training_effect:
    high_impact_threshold: 3.0      # Aerobic + Anaerobic TE
    moderate_impact_threshold: 2.5
    very_high_threshold: 4.0        # Extreme effort detection
  heart_rate:
    zone_threshold: 0.7             # % of time in high zones
    high_intensity_threshold: 0.85  # % of max HR
  duration:
    minimum_seconds: 1800           # Ignore activities <30min
    long_duration_minutes: 90       # Flag long sessions
```

**Integration with AI Prompt:**
The activity breakdown is passed to Claude with interpretation guidelines explaining musculoskeletal stress, neuromuscular fatigue, and recovery timelines for different impact levels.

#### 7. **Real-Time Plan Adaptation**

```python
async def adapt_training_plan(
    self, 
    current_plan_id: int,
    today_date: str,
    readiness_score: int
) -> AdaptedPlan:
    """
    Modifies upcoming workouts based on today's readiness.
    
    Example scenarios:
    
    Scenario 1: HRV crash
    - Planned: Hard interval session
    - Readiness: 45/100 (HRV down 20%, poor sleep)
    - Adaptation: Change to easy run, push intervals to tomorrow or next week
    
    Scenario 2: Feeling great after planned easy day
    - Planned: Easy run
    - Readiness: 95/100 (all metrics excellent)
    - Adaptation: Keep easy run (recovery is important), move next hard session up
    
    Scenario 3: Illness detected
    - Planned: Long run
    - Readiness: 30/100 (HRV very low, elevated RHR)
    - Adaptation: Rest, cancel next 2-3 days, focus on recovery
    
    The AI adjusts the entire week/plan to maintain progression while respecting recovery.
    """

# AI analysis thresholds (dynamically injected into prompts)
thresholds:
  readiness:
    critical: 20      # <20 = mandate rest day
    poor: 40          # 20-40 = strong consideration for rest
    low: 60           # 40-60 = recommend easy/recovery
    moderate: 75      # 60-75 = moderate training appropriate
  hrv_drop_pct: 10           # % drop from baseline = red flag
  resting_hr_elevated_bpm: 5 # bpm above baseline = incomplete recovery
  sleep_hours_min: 6         # Minimum adequate sleep
  acwr_moderate: 1.3         # Caution threshold
  acwr_high: 1.5             # High injury risk
  no_rest_days: 7            # Consecutive days = mandate rest

# Activity classification rules

### Interaction with AI

**AI Chat Interface:**
```
You: Why did you recommend tempo instead of intervals today?

AI: Great question! Here's my reasoning:

1. Training Pattern: You did a hard interval session on Friday (5 
   days ago), which was excellent quality. Your body has recovered 
   well from that.

2. Progressive Overload: Your plan calls for increasing your 
   threshold pace endurance. Last week you did 20min at threshold, 
   today's 25min builds on that.

3. Friday's Big Session: You have a VO2 max interval session 
   planned for Friday (8x800m). I'm spacing out your high-intensity 
   work to optimize both quality and recovery.

4. Sunday's Long Run: With a 22km long run on Sunday, today's 
   tempo run provides quality without excessive fatigue that would 
   compromise your long run.

The rhythm is: Easy (Mon), Easy (Tue), Tempo (Wed), Easy (Thu), 
Intervals (Fri), Easy (Sat), Long (Sun). This gives you 2 quality 
sessions with adequate recovery between them.

Want me to explain the Friday interval session structure?
```

```
You: My legs feel a bit heavy today. Should I still do the tempo?

AI: Good that you're listening to your body! Let me check your data:

Your HRV (62ms) and resting HR (48) both look normal, which is 
positive. However, "heavy legs" can be an early warning sign.

RECOMMENDATION: Start with a 10-minute easy warm-up and assess.

If after 10 minutes:
- Legs feel loose → Proceed with tempo as planned
- Still feel heavy → Switch to 45min easy run, Zone 2

I've prepared an alternative easy workout for you just in case. 
There's no shame in taking it easy - better to have a great 
interval session Friday than force a mediocre tempo today.

Should I adjust Friday's workout if you do the easy run today?
```

STATUS: GREEN - Training load is appropriate

You're in the sweet spot! Current load is challenging your fitness
without excessive injury risk.

NEXT WEEK PLAN:
Maintain current volume. Your body is adapting well.

WARNING THRESHOLD:
If ACWR exceeds 1.35, I'll recommend an easy week.
```

### 3. Sleep-Performance Correlation

```python
async def analyze_sleep_impact() -> SleepAnalysis:
    """
    Finds patterns between sleep and performance.
    
    Analyzes:
    - Optimal sleep duration for you
    - Sleep quality vs workout quality
    - Sleep stages and recovery
    - Best bedtime for you
    
    Example insights:
    - "Your best workouts occur after 7.5-8.5 hours sleep"
    - "Performance drops 12% when sleep < 6.5 hours"
    - "Deep sleep below 90min correlates with poor recovery"
    - "You need 8 hours sleep before long runs for best results"
    """
```

### 4. HR-Pace Efficiency

```python
async def analyze_cardiac_efficiency(activity_type: str = "running") -> EfficiencyAnalysis:
    """
    Tracks improvement in heart rate efficiency.
    
    Calculates:
    - Pace at given HR over time
    - HR at given pace over time
    - Aerobic decoupling
    
    Example:
    "3 months ago: 5:30/km at 150 bpm
     Today: 5:00/km at 150 bpm
     
     Improvement: 30 seconds/km at same effort!
     This indicates improved aerobic fitness."
    """
```

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### MVP Endpoint Surface

Keep the initial API slim—just enough for the dashboard, automation, and manual testing:

```python
# Daily recommendations
GET  /api/recommendations/today
POST /api/recommendations/adapt-plan

# Core data access
GET  /api/health/summary?date={YYYY-MM-DD}
GET  /api/activities?start_date={}&end_date={}

# Training plan lifecycle
GET  /api/training/plans/current
POST /api/training/plans   # create or regenerate plan
PUT  /api/training/plans/{plan_id}/workouts/{workout_id}  # mark complete/update

# Operations
POST /api/sync/manual
POST /api/chat             # AI chat endpoint with streaming response
```

### Backlog Endpoints (Optional Later)

Document other endpoints—exports, detailed analytics, broad historical queries—in the backlog so they do not block MVP delivery. Implement them once the core loop is stable.

## 🚀 Implementation Instructions for Claude Code

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

**Step 1: Project Setup**
```bash
1. Create project structure as defined above
2. Set up virtual environment
3. Install dependencies:
   - fastapi
   - uvicorn
   - sqlalchemy
   - garminconnect
   - anthropic
   - pandas
   - plotly
   - apscheduler
   - python-dotenv
   - pydantic
   - aiofiles
4. Create .env.example file with required variables
```

**Step 2: Database Setup**
```bash
1. Implement database models (database_models.py)
2. Create database migration/initialization script
3. Add indexes for performance
4. Test database operations
```

**Step 3: Garmin Integration**
```bash
1. Implement GarminService class
2. Add authentication with token caching
3. Create methods for fetching:
   - Daily metrics
   - Sleep data
   - Activities
   - HRV readings
   - Heart rate samples
4. Implement error handling and retries
5. Test with your Garmin account
```

### Phase 1.5: MFA Authentication Implementation ✅ COMPLETE

**Web UI for MFA Code Entry (`/manual/mfa`):**
```python
# Two-step process:
1. Request verification code - triggers Garmin to send email/SMS
2. Enter 6-digit code - completes authentication and caches tokens

# Endpoints implemented:
GET  /manual/test         # Test if cached tokens work
GET  /manual/mfa          # Display MFA entry form
POST /manual/mfa/request  # Trigger new MFA code
POST /manual/mfa          # Submit MFA code and authenticate
```

**Token Caching:**
- Tokens stored in `.garmin_tokens/` directory
- Persistent across application restarts
- Eliminates need for repeated MFA authentication
- Delete token file to force re-authentication

**Error Handling:**
- Distinguishes between HTTP errors, MFA failures, profile fetch issues
- Gracefully degrades when profile API fails but OAuth succeeds
- Provides fallback when get_user_summary() has bugs

4. Build plan adaptation system
5. Test with different goals (5K, 10K, marathon, etc.)
```

### Phase 3: Web Interface (Week 3)

**Step 7: API Routes**
```bash
1. Implement all health data endpoints
2. Add training plan endpoints
3. Create recommendation endpoints

5. Create AI chat interface
6. Add interactive charts with Plotly
7. Make it responsive for mobile
```

### Phase 4: Automation & Notifications (Week 4)

**Step 9: Scheduled Tasks**
```bash
1. Set up APScheduler in a dedicated runner (CLI script or separate process)
2. Ensure only one scheduler instance runs across environments (use lock file or single-service deployment)
3. Create daily sync job (runs at 8 AM)
4. Add automatic AI analysis after sync
5. Implement plan adaptation checks
6. Test scheduling with shorter intervals
```

**Step 10: Notification System**
```bash

## 🎨 Dashboard Wireframes

### Main Dashboard Layout (UPDATED - 2025-10-20: Recommendation-First Design)

**Design Philosophy:**
The dashboard now leads with the AI recommendation prominently at the top, followed by supporting recovery metrics. This "recommendation-first" approach ensures users immediately see their daily workout guidance without scrolling.

**Key Features:**
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Custom CSS styling (`app/static/css/dashboard.css`)
- Interactive JavaScript features (`app/static/js/dashboard.js`)
- Graceful degradation when metrics unavailable
- Visual hierarchy: AI guidance → Recovery metrics → Historical data

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Credentials Storage**
   - Load Garmin and SMTP credentials from environment variables or a secrets manager (never commit them)
   - Protect `.env` files with filesystem permissions and document rotation steps
   - If long-term storage outside env vars is required, add encryption + key management as a future enhancement

2. **API Security**
   - Add authentication for API endpoints

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Garmin login fails**
```bash
Solution:
1. Check credentials in .env file
2. Use web UI at http://localhost:8002/manual/mfa for MFA code entry
3. Ensure garminconnect==0.2.30 (project is pinned to this version with a Python 3.14 compatibility patch)
4. Delete .garmin_tokens/ directory to force fresh authentication
5. If rate-limited, wait 20-30 minutes before retry
6. Check GitHub issues: https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect
```

**Issue: get_user_summary() returns TypeError**
```bash
Solution:
- Known issue in garminconnect library
- GarminService has automatic fallback to get_stats()
- Data still available, just in different format
- No action needed - handled automatically
```

**Issue: "Multiple OTP emails" or repeated MFA requests**
```bash
Solution:
- Only click "Request Verification Code" once
- Use the most recent 6-digit code received
- Clear separation between request and submit buttons in UI
- If receiving multiple codes, wait for rate limit to clear (20-30 min)
```

**Issue: garminconnect library breaks (Garmin changed their API)**
```bash
Solution:
1. Check GitHub issues: https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect
2. Look for updated versions or community forks
3. Temporary workaround: Manual data export from Garmin Connect
   - Export FIT files manually
   - Import into system using `scripts/import_fit_files.py` (backlog utility to build if Garmin API access breaks)
4. Long-term: Consider building Apple HealthKit version instead
```

**Issue: AI analysis too slow**
```bash
Solution:
1. Reduce data context window
2. Implement better caching
3. Use faster Claude model
4. Optimize data preparation
```

**Issue: Database growing too large**
```bash
Solution:
1. Implement data archiving
2. Remove old HR samples (keep daily averages)
3. Compress historical data
4. Move to PostgreSQL if needed
```
