# AI-Powered Training Optimization System
## Project Specification

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

Build an intelligent fitness training optimization system that:
- **Automatically fetches** Garmin health and training data
- **Analyzes patterns** using Claude AI to understand your body's signals
- **Generates daily workout recommendations** based on recovery status
- **Creates adaptive training plans** aligned with your goals
- **Prevents overtraining and injury** through smart load management
- **Provides actionable insights** through AI-powered analysis

### 🔍 MVP Scope vs. Advanced Enhancements

To keep the build focused while still pointing to future capabilities, treat the project as two concentric scopes:

- **MVP (deliver now):**
  - Automated Garmin data ingestion, storage, and FastAPI access
  - Daily readiness analysis with Claude, adaptive training plan updates, and notification delivery
  - Web dashboard with today’s recommendation, weekly plan, key metrics, and AI chat
  - Supporting scripts for setup, manual sync, and backfill, plus core tests and documentation
- **Advanced Backlog (later):**
  - Deep analytics (race predictions, sleep-performance correlations, efficiency trends)
  - Third-party integrations (Strava, TrainingPeaks), mobile/IoT extensions, and social features
  - Expanded data exports, PDF reporting, and other “nice to have” endpoints

Everything else in this spec is organized to make the MVP attainable first, with advanced ideas called out explicitly as optional follow-on work.

### ⚠️ Critical Considerations Before Starting

**1. Unofficial Garmin Integration**
This system uses the `garminconnect` Python library, which is unofficial and reverse-engineers Garmin's web API. This means:
- ❌ Not endorsed by Garmin
- ❌ May violate Garmin's Terms of Service
- ⚠️ Could break if Garmin updates their system
- ✅ Works reliably for personal use (as of Oct 2025)
- ✅ Actively maintained by community

**VERIFIED STATUS (October 18, 2025):**
- ✅ garminconnect==0.2.30 confirmed working with Python 3.14 (compatibility patch applied via `app/compat/pydantic_eval_patch.py`)
- ✅ MFA authentication flow implemented and tested
- ✅ Token caching in `.garmin_tokens/` directory working reliably
- ✅ ALL 72 GET methods tested and documented (see GARMIN_API_DATA_AVAILABLE.md)
- ⚠️ get_user_summary() method has known bugs - use fallback to get_stats()

**MFA Authentication:**
- First-time login requires 6-digit verification code from Garmin
- Web UI at `/manual/mfa` provides user-friendly code entry
- Tokens cached for subsequent logins without re-authentication
- Rate limiting: Wait 20-30 minutes between failed attempts

**Alternative**: Use Apple HealthKit if you're willing to build iOS-only.

**2. Claude API Costs**
Estimated monthly costs for AI analysis:
- Daily readiness analysis: ~$0.10-0.20/day
- Weekly insights: ~$0.50/week
- Training plan generation: ~$1-2/plan
- Chat queries: ~$0.05-0.15/query
- **Total estimate: $5-15/month** for regular use

Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 (most intelligent model). Can reduce costs by:
- Using prompt caching (automatically enabled)
- Reducing analysis frequency
- Limiting data context window

**3. Time Commitment**
- Initial setup: 4-8 hours
- Full implementation: 20-40 hours over 5 weeks
- Daily usage: 5 minutes (automated after setup)

**4. Technical Prerequisites**
- Python programming knowledge (intermediate level)
- Basic understanding of APIs and databases
- Familiarity with FastAPI or Flask
- Understanding of heart rate training zones and HRV
- Comfortable with command line

## 🤖 AI Analysis Engine - CORE FEATURE

### AIAnalyzer Class (`services/ai_analyzer.py`)

This is the intelligence center of the system. It uses Claude AI to analyze your data and provide recommendations.

#### Key Methods:

#### 1. **Daily Readiness Analysis** (MOST IMPORTANT)

```python
async def analyze_daily_readiness(self, date: str) -> DailyReadinessResponse:
    """
    Analyzes whether you should train hard, easy, or rest today.
    
    This runs every morning automatically and is the core feature.
    
    Inputs analyzed:
    - Last night's sleep (duration, quality, sleep stages)
    - This morning's HRV (compared to 7-day and 30-day baseline)
    - Resting heart rate (compared to baseline)
    - Yesterday's training load
    - Last 7 days cumulative training stress
    - Current acute:chronic workload ratio
    - Previous day's recovery status

    Minimum viable data set:
    - Sleep summary, resting HR, HRV, recent activities/training load

    Optional enrichments (use when Garmin provides them, fall back gracefully otherwise):
    - Body battery, stress score, detailed sleep stages, recovery time hints
    
    Output:
    {
        "date": "2025-10-16",
        "readiness_score": 82,  # 0-100
        "recommendation": "moderate",  # high_intensity | moderate | easy | rest
        "confidence": "high",  # high | medium | low
        "key_factors": [
            "Sleep quality excellent (8.2 hours, 85% score)",
            "HRV normal at 62ms (your 7-day avg: 58ms)",
            "Resting HR at baseline: 48 bpm",
            "Training load stable, no spikes"
        ],
        "red_flags": [
            "Slight elevation in morning HR (+3 bpm from baseline)",
            "Only 2 hours deep sleep vs your usual 2.5 hours"
        ],
        "suggested_workout": {
            "type": "tempo_run",
            "description": "45-minute tempo run with 10min warm-up, 25min at threshold pace (zone 4), 10min cool-down",

            "rationale": "Your recovery metrics are good. Body is ready for moderate-high intensity. Threshold work will improve lactate clearance without excessive stress."
        },

                "target_hr_zone": "2"
            }
        ],
        "recovery_tips": [
            "Focus on hydration today - you tend to perform better when well-hydrated",
            "Consider foam rolling before workout - helps with your typical calf tightness",

    ```

**AI Prompt Structure:**
```python
prompt = f"""
You are an expert running coach and sports scientist analyzing an athlete's readiness to train.

ATHLETE PROFILE:
{user_profile}

TODAY'S PHYSIOLOGICAL DATA:
- Date: {date}
- Sleep last night: {sleep_data}
- HRV this morning: {hrv_data} (7-day baseline: {hrv_baseline}, 30-day: {hrv_30day})
- Resting HR: {rhr_data} (baseline: {rhr_baseline})
- Body Battery (if available): {body_battery}
- Stress level (if available): {stress_level}

RECENT TRAINING HISTORY (Last 7 days):
{recent_activities}

TRAINING LOAD METRICS:
- Acute training load (7-day): {acute_load}
- Chronic training load (28-day): {chronic_load}
- Acute:Chronic Ratio: {acwr} (optimal: 0.8-1.3, injury risk if >1.5)
- Current fitness: {fitness}
- Current fatigue: {fatigue}
- Form (fitness - fatigue): {form}

TRAINING GOAL:
{training_goal}

NEXT KEY WORKOUT IN PLAN:
{next_planned_workout}

TASK:
Analyze the athlete's readiness to train TODAY and provide:
1. Readiness score (0-100)
2. Training recommendation (high_intensity, moderate, easy, or rest)
3. Specific workout suggestion aligned with their goal
4. Key factors influencing the decision
5. Any red flags or concerns
6. Recovery optimization tips

Return response in this EXACT JSON format:
{json_schema}

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:
- HRV drop >10% from baseline = possible illness/overtraining, recommend easy or rest
- Resting HR elevated >5 bpm = stress/fatigue, scale back intensity
- Sleep <6 hours or sleep score <60 = inadequate recovery
- ACWR >1.5 = injury risk, recommend easy week
- Back-to-back high intensity days = risky, alternate with easy days
- After long runs (>90 min), need 24-48 hours easy
- Trust the data but also acknowledge subjective feel matters

Be specific with workout details (pace, HR zones, duration, structure).
"""
```

**Implementation note - VERIFIED:** All critical endpoints confirmed working (tested October 17, 2025):
- ✅ `get_sleep_data()` - Sleep duration, stages (deep/light/REM), quality score
- ✅ `get_hrv_data()` - HRV summary with baseline values, individual readings
- ✅ `get_heart_rates()` - Resting HR (42 bpm confirmed), max HR, all-day readings
- ✅ `get_stats()` - Steps, distance, calories, active minutes
- ✅ `get_stress_data()` - All-day stress monitoring, average/max stress
- ✅ `get_body_battery()` - Charged/drained amounts, current level
- ✅ `get_training_readiness()` - Daily readiness assessment
- ✅ `get_activities()` - Complete activity history with HR zones, splits, weather

See GARMIN_API_DATA_AVAILABLE.md for complete list of all 72 tested methods.

**Known Issues:**
- `get_user_summary()` may return list instead of dict - use fallback to `get_stats()`
- Rate limiting after ~5 failed MFA attempts - wait 20-30 minutes

#### 2. **Weekly Training Pattern Analysis**

```python
async def analyze_weekly_patterns(self, start_date: str, end_date: str) -> WeeklyInsights:
    """
    Analyzes a week (or multiple weeks) of training for patterns and balance.
    
    Identifies:
    - Training load distribution (are you doing too much intensity?)
    - Recovery adequacy (are rest days actually restful?)
    - Workout variety (too much running? need cross-training?)
    - Sleep and HRV trends
    - Overtraining risk
    
    Output includes:
    - Training load score
    - Intensity distribution (easy/moderate/hard ratio)
    - Overtraining risk score
    - Recommendations for next week
    - Specific adjustments needed
    """
```

#### 3. **Performance Trend Analysis**

```python
async def analyze_performance_trends(self, metric: str, period_days: int = 90) -> TrendAnalysis:
    """
    Analyzes long-term trends in key performance indicators.
    
    Metrics analyzed:
    - VO2 Max progression
    - Running pace at same HR (efficiency)
    - HR at same pace (fitness indicator)
    - HRV baseline trend
    - Resting HR trend
    - Body composition changes
    
    Identifies:
    - Improvements or plateaus
    - Potential causes
    - Breakthrough moments
    - Recommendations to break through plateaus
    """
```

#### 4. **Training Plan Generation** (NEW FEATURE)

```python
async def generate_training_plan(
    self, 
    goal: str,
    target_date: str,
    current_fitness_level: dict,
    constraints: dict
) -> TrainingPlan:
    """
    Generates a complete periodized training plan to achieve a goal.
    
    Example goals:
    - "Run a sub-3:30 marathon on December 1, 2025"
    - "Improve 5K time from 22:00 to 20:30"
    - "Build base fitness for 6 months"
    - "Recover from injury and return to running"
    
    Inputs:

### Interaction with AI

**AI Chat Interface:**
```
You: Why did you recommend tempo instead of intervals today?

AI: Great question! Here's my reasoning:

1. Training Pattern: You did a hard interval session on Friday (5 
   days ago), which was excellent quality. Your body has recovered 
   well from that.

2. Progressive Overload: Your plan calls for increasing your 
   threshold pace endurance. Last week you did 20min at threshold, 
   today's 25min builds on that.

3. Friday's Big Session: You have a VO2 max interval session 
   planned for Friday (8x800m). I'm spacing out your high-intensity 
   work to optimize both quality and recovery.

4. Sunday's Long Run: With a 22km long run on Sunday, today's 
   tempo run provides quality without excessive fatigue that would 
   compromise your long run.

The rhythm is: Easy (Mon), Easy (Tue), Tempo (Wed), Easy (Thu), 
Intervals (Fri), Easy (Sat), Long (Sun). This gives you 2 quality 
sessions with adequate recovery between them.

Want me to explain the Friday interval session structure?
```

```
You: My legs feel a bit heavy today. Should I still do the tempo?

AI: Good that you're listening to your body! Let me check your data:

Your HRV (62ms) and resting HR (48) both look normal, which is 
positive. However, "heavy legs" can be an early warning sign.

RECOMMENDATION: Start with a 10-minute easy warm-up and assess.

If after 10 minutes:
- Legs feel loose → Proceed with tempo as planned
- Still feel heavy → Switch to 45min easy run, Zone 2

I've prepared an alternative easy workout for you just in case. 
There's no shame in taking it easy - better to have a great 
interval session Friday than force a mediocre tempo today.

Should I adjust Friday's workout if you do the easy run today?
```

```

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

### System Health
- Daily sync success rate: >95%
- AI analysis completion time: <2 minutes
- API response time: <500ms
- Database query performance: <100ms

### Training Optimization
- Recommendation acceptance rate (track if user follows recommendation)
- Injury/overtraining prevention (track HRV trends)
- Training plan adherence rate
- User satisfaction with AI recommendations

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Credentials Storage**
   - Load Garmin and SMTP credentials from environment variables or a secrets manager (never commit them)
   - Protect `.env` files with filesystem permissions and document rotation steps
   - If long-term storage outside env vars is required, add encryption + key management as a future enhancement

2. **API Security**
   - Add authentication for API endpoints
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Input validation and sanitization

3. **Data Privacy**
   - Health data is sensitive
   - No external sharing without consent
   - Secure database access
   - Regular backups

---

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Local Development
```bash
# Run on your computer
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
# Access at http://localhost:8000
# Start scheduler separately
python scripts/run_scheduler.py
```

### Option 2: Home Server (Raspberry Pi, NAS)
```bash
# Run 24/7 on home server
# Use Docker for easy deployment
docker-compose up -d
# Ensure scheduler runs as its own service/container
```

### Option 3: Cloud Deployment (Advanced)
```bash
# Deploy to cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)
# Use managed database
# Set up HTTPS
# Configure domain name
# Run scheduler via managed cron/worker (Cloud Scheduler, ECS task, etc.)
```

---

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Garmin login fails**
```bash
Solution:
1. Check credentials in .env file
2. Use web UI at http://localhost:8002/manual/mfa for MFA code entry
3. Ensure garminconnect==0.2.30 (project is pinned to this version with a Python 3.14 compatibility patch)
4. Delete .garmin_tokens/ directory to force fresh authentication
5. If rate-limited, wait 20-30 minutes before retry
6. Check GitHub issues: https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect
```

**Issue: get_user_summary() returns TypeError**
```bash
Solution:
- Known issue in garminconnect library
- GarminService has automatic fallback to get_stats()
- Data still available, just in different format
- No action needed - handled automatically
```

**Issue: "Multiple OTP emails" or repeated MFA requests**
```bash
Solution:
- Only click "Request Verification Code" once
- Use the most recent 6-digit code received
- Clear separation between request and submit buttons in UI
- If receiving multiple codes, wait for rate limit to clear (20-30 min)
```

**Issue: garminconnect library breaks (Garmin changed their API)**
```bash
Solution:
1. Check GitHub issues: https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect
2. Look for updated versions or community forks
3. Temporary workaround: Manual data export from Garmin Connect
   - Export FIT files manually
   - Import into system using `scripts/import_fit_files.py` (backlog utility to build if Garmin API access breaks)
4. Long-term: Consider building Apple HealthKit version instead
```

**Issue: AI analysis too slow**
```bash
Solution:
1. Reduce data context window
2. Implement better caching
3. Use faster Claude model
4. Optimize data preparation
```

**Issue: Database growing too large**
```bash
Solution:
1. Implement data archiving
2. Remove old HR samples (keep daily averages)
3. Compress historical data
4. Move to PostgreSQL if needed
```
